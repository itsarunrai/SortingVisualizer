# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a Sorting Visualizer that demonstrates various sorting algorithms. The algorithms visualized include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble Sort.

## Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms
- Adjustable speed for visualization
- Step-by-step execution for better understanding
- User-friendly interface

## Algorithms Included

- **Merge Sort**: A divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
- **Quick Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm using divide and conquer, selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region.
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/itsarunrai/SortingVisualizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd sortingvisualizer
    ```
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
